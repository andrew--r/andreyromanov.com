  Hi! I’m a front-end web developer. I live in ~~Omsk~~ → Moscow (Russia) and work at ~~Innova~~ → ~~Avito~~ → ~~Sticker.place~~ → Joom. I’m passionate about design and music.

  ## What I made

  * [For Web](https://forwebdev.ru), one of the largest russian front-end news aggregators
  * [frontend case studies](https://github.com/andrew--r/frontend-case-studies), a curated list of technical talks and articles about real world enterprise frontend development
  * [channels](https://github.com/andrew--r/channels), a collection of useful YouTube channels for javascript developers and web designers
